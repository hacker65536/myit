$ gcloud container clusters create vtest --machine-type n1-standard-4 --num-nodes 5 --scopes storage-rw
WARNING: Starting in 1.12, new clusters will have basic authentication disabled by default. Basic authentication can be enabled (or disabled) manually using the `--[no-]enable-basic-auth` flag.
WARNING: Starting in 1.12, new clusters will not have a client certificate issued. You can manually enable (or disable) the issuance of the client certificate using the `--[no-]issue-client-certificate` flag.
WARNING: Currently VPC-native is not the default mode during cluster creation. In the future, this will become the default mode and can be disabled using `--no-enable-ip-alias` flag. Use `--[no-]enable-ip-alias` flag to suppress this warning.
WARNING: Starting in 1.12, default node pools in new clusters will have their legacy Compute Engine instance metadata endpoints disabled by default. To create a cluster with legacy instance metadata endpoints disabled in the default node pool, run `clusters create` with the flag `--metadata disable-legacy-endpoints=true`.
This will enable the autorepair feature for nodes. Please see https://cloud.google.com/kubernetes-engine/docs/node-auto-repair for more information on node autorepairs.
WARNING: The behavior of --scopes will change in a future gcloud release: service-control and service-management scopes will no longer be added to what is specified in --scopes. To use these scopes, add them explicitly to --scopes. To use the new behavior, set container/new_scopes_behavior property (gcloud config set container/new_scopes_behavior true).
WARNING: Starting in Kubernetes v1.10, new clusters will no longer get compute-rw and storage-ro scopes added to what is specified in --scopes (though the latter will remain included in the default --scopes). To use these scopes, add them explicitly to --scopes. To use the new behavior, set container/new_scopes_behavior property (gcloud config set container/new_scopes_behavior true).
